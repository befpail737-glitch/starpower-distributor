3. Rich Product List & Detail Pages, News List & Detail Pages, Technical Support Pages:
All detail pages must be aesthetically pleasing, professional, and rich in content.
4. Content is King - Building Professional Content:
Product Center:
Not just a model list. Provide detailed English introductions, key parameters, application areas, advantage comparisons, and recommended matching part numbers for each important product series.
Product Images: Use specific, high-quality images corresponding to each product, not generic ones.
Example Image URL: /cdn-cgi/image/width=800,quality=85,format=auto/images/products/IGBT/GD10PJA120L2S.webp
Descriptive Content: Add an original 200-300 word description below the H1 title on each product category page. This content should detail the general characteristics, main series (e.g., IGBT, SiC, IPM), core advantages, and main application areas of this product category (e.g., Power Modules). Naturally integrate keywords like "Starpower module distributor", "Starpower IGBT selection guide".
"Selection Guide" Entry: Below the description, add a prominent link to a technical support article: "How to Choose the Most Suitable Starpower Module for Your Project?"
Visual Classification: If a major category has multiple sub-series (e.g., Power Modules have IGBT, SiC), display these sub-series with image-text cards instead of simple text links. Each card can link to a more granular list page (if product volume warrants it).
Product Detail Page Requirements (Example: Starpower GD10PJA120L2S IGBT Module):
Original "Distributor Review" or "Application Interpretation": Include a section with a professional, subjective interpretation written by your company's FAE (Field Application Engineer) about this specific model, highlighting its unique advantages or common applications.
"Alternative Part Numbers" and "Complementary Part Numbers": List potential substitutes or frequently paired components.
FAQ Module: Create an FAQ module for this specific model, answering 3-5 common questions engineers ask.
Product Schema.org Structured Data: Implement JSON-LD format Product Schema markup in the HTML, explicitly telling search engines the product name, SKU (model number), brand (Starpower), description, image, price range (or availability status), user ratings (if any), etc.
Product Data: All product data must be sourced from the Starpower Semiconductor official website to ensure authenticity.
Diverse CTAs: Offer multiple options based on engineers' needs at different stages:
"Download Datasheet" (Information gathering stage)
"Request Sample" (Evaluation stage)
"Get a Quote" (Procurement stage)
"Consult Technical Questions" (R&D stage, links to contact form, specify for FAE)
Technical Support/Blog Requirements:
Categories: Establish clear categories (e.g., Selection Guides, Application Notes, Troubleshooting, New Product Reviews). Each category should have its own dedicated page (.../support/guides/) to optimize for more specific keywords.
Tags: Tag each article with relevant technical keywords (e.g., IGBT, SiC, BLDC Motor, CAN Bus). Clicking a tag should aggregate all related articles. This significantly improves user experience and internal linking.
Contextual Links: When mentioning a specific product model (e.g., GD10PJA120L2S) in an article, link it to its product detail page. If a related concept (e.g., IGBT driver) is mentioned, link it to another article explaining IGBT drivers.
"Related Articles" Module: At the end of each article, automatically recommend 3-5 most relevant articles based on the current article's category or tags.
Author Profiles: Create separate author pages for your company's main FAEs. Pages should include the author's real name, photo, technical expertise, and experience.
Associate Authors: Link the author's name on each article to their profile page. This demonstrates the Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-A-T) of your content to search engines and users.
Solutions Requirements:
Independent URL Structure: E.g., /solutions/ev-charging/, /solutions/solar-inverters/. Page titles and content should revolve around "Industry + Solution."
Publish 5 Solutions.
Rich List Page Content: Add a summary for each solution on the list page, including core keywords and application scenarios.
Structured Content: Use H2, H3 tags to break down content into modules like "Solution Block Diagram," "Core Advantages," "Recommended Bill of Materials (BOM List)," "Application Scenarios."
Rich Media: Each solution must include a solution block diagram with detailed alt attributes for the image.
Example Image URL: /cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,quality=85,format=auto/images/solutions/ev-charger-block-diagram.webp
BOM & Internal Links: In the "Recommended Bill of Materials," list key IC models used in the solution. Each model should link to its corresponding product detail page on your website, building a strong internal link network.
News Center Requirements:
Separate Categories: "Company News" and "Industry Insights" should be distinct. "Company News" has limited external search appeal, while "Industry Insights" can optimize for industry hot topics. When writing industry insights, cite authoritative sources and add your own interpretations to create valuable content.
Article Theme Suggestions:
"How to Identify and Choose a Reliable Starpower Distributor?"
"5 Major Advantages of Purchasing Starpower Products from a Distributor"
"Litong: More Than Just a Starpower Distributor, Your Technical Partner"
"The Role of SiC Modules in Next-Generation EV Powertrains"
"Starpower's Latest IGBT Technology for High-Efficiency Solar Inverters"
Purpose: Directly capture search traffic from users looking for and evaluating distributors, or researching industry trends.
Schema.org Markup: Use Article or NewsArticle Schema markup for "News Center" articles, especially "Industry Insights." Include JSON-LD code in the HTML to inform search engines of the article's title, author, publication date, publisher, and other structured information. This helps achieve rich snippets in search results and improves click-through rates.
Detail Pages for News, Products, Solutions, Technical Support:
Each category should have 5 articles/pages.
Depth and Length: Articles must be detailed and substantial, reflecting a professional and authoritative source. Each article should be a valuable, independent information source.
"About Us" Page: Detailed introduction to the company's history, team strength, and client case studies. Clearly state: "We are a core distributor of Starpower Semiconductor."
Introduce your history of cooperation with Starpower, and highlight your advantages (e.g., inventory depth, technical support team, logistics capabilities, etc.).
Naturally use keywords like "Starpower distributor," "Starpower agent" throughout the page text.
Mention providing digital certificates for product tracking and customs declarations to enhance trust and authority.
"Contact Us" Page: Provide various contact methods, including a contact form, phone numbers, email, and address.
5. Strengthen Internal Linking:
When writing technical articles, always link to the relevant product detail page if a product model is mentioned.
At the end of product detail pages and article detail pages, add modules for "Related Products" or "Related Articles."
From product detail pages, link to relevant application notes or solution articles.
6. Visual Assets (SVG & Abstract Backgrounds):
Vector Icons (SVG):
For product categories (e.g., IGBT, SiC, IPM, MOSFET), design and generate a series of simple, professional, and uniformly styled SVG vector icons.
For pages like News, About Us, Contact Us, design and generate a series of simple, professional SVG vector illustrations or cover images.
Abstract Backgrounds (SVG): For website banners or backgrounds, generate abstract, tech-themed patterns (e.g., circuit board textures, futuristic lines) in SVG format, fitting the "Starpower distributor" industry aesthetic.
Logo (SVG): Design a simple, text-based or basic-shape SVG format company logo.
Image URLs: Provide correct URLs for all list and detail page images.
Example Image Path: /cdn-cgi/image/width=...,quality=...,format=auto/images/products/IGBT/product-name.webp
